        Federalist is undergoing a name change to be more aligned with our cloud.gov suite of services. We are transitioning the name from Federalist to <span>cloud.gov Pages</span>! Pages will be the same great services provided with your current Federalist agreement, just with a new name and new features to come. In the upcoming months, we will be migrating our Federalist application to itâ€™s new home on cloud.gov. We will update this alert as more information becomes available.
